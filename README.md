# CBR-Libary-Downloads-Manager
A Simple program to help organise digital comic collections and downloads sorting.

I threw this together to help check for new files in my various downloads folders that where new files not in my 
comic libary.

I thought it was becoming useful so i thought I'd chuck it up on here.

Basically, it searches the nominated 'Source' folder for .CBR and .CBZ files, exculding qtorrents incomlete files and unwanted files.

(This is specific to qtorrent atm, I plan to implement custom filters adn profiles to exclude files from various software)

It then compares all found files with all the found files in your chosen folder (Your libary), and highlights new files.

Current only by filename.

Anyway, work in progress. The UI is terrible, like i said it was only thrown together. Now let the cleanup begin!

I plan to extend this to watch downloads folders, and auto extract movies into specified media folders, and cleanup files older than a few weeks (depending on your options etc). Basically a one stop torrent folder organiser/ Auto file manager.
